                       -----

The relex-semantic-algs.txt file contains rules for extracting 
relationship types from the link grammar.  

; General remaks about the structure of the files:
;
;  Empty or blank node is shown by "%"
;
;  Regular expression is introduced by "\"
;  In regular expressions, "\." is converted to "[a-z\*]"
;     (meaning any lower case or the * character)
;     (also meaning that there is no way to represent a "." in a regular expression)


Some notes about verb tenses:
-----------------------------

I've identified 35 cases: sixteen perfect, sixteen imperfect, three
oddball cases. Relex produces the right output for all be the very
last, which is a confusing case anyway.

   Imperfect:

       * "I wake" I wake every morning at six. present
       * "I woke" I woke up this morning at six. past
       * "I will wake" I will wake tomorrow at six. future
       * "I would wake" I would wake every day at dawn. infinitive

   Imperfect passive:

       * "I am woken." (Every day, I am woken by that damned dog.)
         present passive
       * "I was woken." (I was woken by the barking). past passive
       * "I will be woken." (I will be woken again, if I don't do
         something about it.) future passive
       * "I would be woken." (I would be woken if I didn't wear ear
         plugs'.) infinitive passive

   Imperfect progressive:

       * "I am waking" I am waking refreshed these days present progressive
       * "I was waking" I was waking refreshed until recently. past progressive
       * "I will be waking" I will be waking in time to make the
         meeting. future progressive
       * "I would be waking" I would be waking on time if my alarm
         clock worked infinitive progressive

   Imperfect passive progressive:

       * "I am being woken" I am being woken every day by the
         barking. present passive progressive
       * "I was being woken" I was being woken by the dog, but then I
         shot it. past passive progressive
       * "I will be being woken" I will be being woken by the dog for
         as long as it stays alive. future passive progressive
       * "I would be being woken" I would be being woken by that dog,
         if I hadn't shot it. inifinitive passive progressive

   There are sixteen more perfect aspects:

   Perfect:

       * "I have woken" ('I have woken on time every day now for
          months) present perfect.
       * "I had woken" (I had woken on time, but then I went back to
          sleep.) past perfect
       * "I will have woken" (As of tommorrow, I will have woken on
          time every day this week.) future perfect.
       * "I would have woken" (I would have woken if the damned alarm
          clock had gone off.) infinitive perfect

   Perfect passive:

       * "I have been woken". (Argh, I have been woken by that dog
         one time too many.) present perfect passive
       * "I had been woken". (I had been woken by that dog almost
         every day, but now that I complained to the neighbors, its
         been taken care of.) past perfect passive
       * "I will have been woken". (If he barks again, I will have
         been woken for the 3rd time tonight.) future perfect passive
       * "I would have been woken" (I would have been woken lst
         night, if I hadn't worn earplugs). infinitive perfect passive

   Perfect progressive:

       * "I have been waking" (I have been waking refreshed ever
         since they put the dog inside.) This is present perfect progressive.
       * "I had been waking" (I had been waking refreshed, until that
         damned rooster moved in next door.) past perfect progressive
       * "I will have been waking" (I will have been waking refreshed
         for 3 months now, once I strangled the rooster by the neck). 
         future perfect progressive
       * "I would have been waking" (I would have been waking
         refreshed, if it weren't for that rooster) infinitive perfect
         progressive

   Perfect passive progressive:

         and so I took some sleeping pills.) past perfect passive progressive
       * "I will have been being woken" (I will have been being woken
         since January.) future perfect passive progressive
       * "I would have been being woken" ... infinitive perfect
         passive progressive

   Infinitives:

       * "I do wake", I do wake on time. present infinitive
       * "I did wake", I'm telling you, I did wake on time!. past infinitive
       * "I am going to wake" I made a promise that I am going to
         wake on time. future infinitive (??)

There are imperatives, too ...
